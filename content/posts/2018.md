I have always read Ire’s yearly Review, which motivate me to share mine. Here’s the recap of my own 2018.

![2018 image](https://res.cloudinary.com/chisom5/image/upload/v1618323912/2018.jpg)

2018 began when I decided to give the so called “New year Resolution” a try, wasn’t a huge fan of it thou. So on the 5th of January, I was in my home town with my Sister and right there I made the best decision of my life by following the snapshot above.

## Personal Challenge

This year i publicly engaged in a challenge known as #100DaysOfCode without any form of guidance, i started randomly to improve my javascript skill, as time goes on i found myself going full time front end development, so i embrace FreeCodeCamp in accomplishing this. On the mid way of this journey things got interested as i enroll for other challenges i saw online

1. Javascript30 by Wes Bos
2. Cs50 by David j. Malan
3. Rapid Web Dev (Favcode) by favour Ori

I found the #javaScript30 helpful as it relate to the javascript skill i intend improving on and as well as the cs50 for problem solving. I completed the Favcode program which emphasis on the html, css and basic JS skill with helpful resources such as udemy course and w3school.

During the course of the 100DaysOfCode challenge i also registered for a remote internship (HngInternship 4.0) organized by hotels.ng. The experience was indeed great

- As I got exposed to using figma for the first time

- I as well learnt collaborating with others via git and github as i experience a lot of merge conflict.

- Learnt some php and mySqli skills

- and lastly some other tools such as TeamViewer.

Although i got disable at stage 4, but the interesting part of it all was that they bring out the best in me and made me see reasons for improvement

## Projects

This year i built a lot of project in the course of my learning few which are listed below.

## Writing

As part of the new year resolution, I started out documenting and It has been awesome, my first article was [“Why is JavaScript seen been executed asynchronously which it isn’t?”](https://codeburst.io/why-is-javascript-seen-been-executed-asynchronously-which-it-isnt-3a3853388e81) which got quite an helpful comment by Stephen Curtis on facebook as to improve. which I then implemented in the second article [“The thing with JavaScript function and the new keyword”](https://codeburst.io/the-thing-with-javascript-function-and-the-new-keyword-10dd0e3763e1). So far I have been able to put up 4 article on medium, thou this wasn’t the plan but i’m happy I started.


## Reading

I planned on reading 20 books this year, but wasn’t able to achieve this and i don’t have any genus reasons for this thou. but i hope to do better next year

## Speaking

If you would asked me I doubt this section of my plan because I do think that tech speakers are genius like extremely “good”. but to my surprise I got an opportunity for this when I was in school to speak at an event for WTMAba by Osumgba Kindness chiamaka but due to my seminar defense scheduled for that every day I declined the offer.

## Life

### Fresh graduate — Computer Engineering(MOUAU)
I’m grateful to God for the gift of life and for seeing me through this phase of my life, It hasn’t been easy as there were countless times I have been cashless, the thought of my project and accommodation finance made me nurse the feeling that I might not push through but God responded in his own way, saying he aren’t done with me yet, friends that turn family gave me hope, they assisted me when I needed It the most, pardon me to say “they carried my matter for their head” and I’m forever loyal to those unnamed friends God bless you guys.

## Recognition

I got feature this year at techmeetupsng.com “Will a computer engineering degree prepare me for a career in tech? — by Pecuilar Ediomo-Abasi.

## New Friend

I met Segebee at Devfest GdgLagos where we spoke about our stack, and then i chipped in the fact that i was job hunting, and he has been helpful on that note. It was a pleasure haven met you

Haven encountered the interesting and fun aspect of 2018, i also had an experience i can never forget. i was defrauded by my neighbour which i entrust my ATM card to around April or so. the experience wasn’t funny at all but everything was sorted out

## What About 2019?

I’m really excited for the new year, I have a lot of great things planned. Here are some of my goals:

1. Personal Development: I’d Like to continue on this path, so my next 100DaysOfCode will be on the Christmas gift daniel bought for me known as The complete Web Developer in 2019: Zero to Mastery. then continue on the path of react and redux.

2. Writing: I’d like to do more on this either technically or some other form.

3. Speaking: Next year i want to invade in this space, i don’t know how but i’m ready to give it a try.

4. Open Source Contribution: I’d like to tap into this.

5. Reading: Just as 2018, I intend doing this very well, by reading 20 books that are not programming related

Cheers to a better and Fun-filled 2019, Season greetings everyone...
